                                    Photosynthesis: process by which light energy is converted to chemical energy
	        Sunlight
6CO2 + 6H2O ----> C6H12O6 + 6O2
Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials used in the process of photosynthesis and producing sugar. 
Cuticles prevents leaves from losing water through evaporation

        Photosynthesis first begins with the light reaction phase with photons from the sun. Water is broken down to H+ and 2O2  and the excited protons (H+ ) are then processed for to NADPH and ATP.  Oxygen then leaves the plant. 
The next phase is the dark reaction phase also known as the Calvin Cycle which doesnâ€™t depend on light.

 Photosynthesis Light Reaction 


Noncyclic Photophosphorylation
Produces ATP using both Photosystem I and II. 
First the photons are sent to photosystem II 680 to a molecule called the primary acceptor. 
Second they are passed down to carriers in the electron transport chain and enter Photosystem I. Some of the energy lost in this process will travel outside the thylakoid membrane. 
Third when he reaction center absorbs light it also splits water into oxygen, hydrogen ions and electrons. This process is called photolysis. 
	Hydrogen ions accumulate inside the thylakoids when photolysis occurs. A proton gradient is established. As the hydrogen ions move through ATP synthase, ADP and Pi produce ATP. (some electrons are lost in making NADP in order to make ATP) 
WHen these electrons in photosystem I receive a second boost of electronics, they're activated again. The electrons are passed through a second electrons transport chain until they reach the final electrons acceptor NADP+ to make NADPH.

                              This is a much simpler pathway to produce ATP when there is a lack of electrons to produce 
NADPH.  Is far less effective than the noncyclic reaction. Therefore NADPH is not produced and water is not split into oxygen and hydrogen ions.

Light Independent Reaction (Calvin Cycle) [Carbon Fixation] (C3 pathway)


1. Calvin cycle starts with 3 ribulose Phosphate [RP]
2. 3 ATP enters to make 3 ribulose bisphosphate [RuBP]
3. 3 carbon molecules enter and attach by rubisco to make Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase.
4. After that phase the compound is unstable and breaks down into two 3-phosphoglycerate [PGA] 
5. Here ATP is used and turns into ADP  and the compound formed is 6 bisphosphoglycerate [DPGA]. 
6. Then Hydrogen ions are attached from NADPH to form 6 glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate [G3P] 
7. G3P is able to make almost any carbon compound and if often known to produce glucose.
8. Next the cycle creates 3 G3Ps to create the RuBP the calvin Cycle started with.
9. Only one molecule of G3P gets to leave the cycle.
