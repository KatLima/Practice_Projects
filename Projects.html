The typical plant leaf includes the following

Upper and lower epidermis – the upper epidermis is the outer layer of the cells
that controls the amount of water that is lost through transpiration.

Stomata – these are pores (holes) in the leaves that are responsible for the exchange of gases between the plant leaves and the atmosphere. 
Carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere and oxygen is released.

Mesophyll – these are photosynthetic (parenchyma) cells that are located between the upper and lower epidermis. 
These cells contain the chloroplasts.

Vascular bundle – these are tissues that form part of the transport system of the plant. 
Vascular bundles consist of xylem and phloem vessels which transport water, dissolved minerals and food to and from the leaves.

Examples of C3 plants incldes:
Rice
Oranges
Lemon
Tea

                 <p>
                     Photorespiration: Sometimes triggered by intense bright light photorespiration can stunt the growth of C3 plants. It’s the pathway that leads to the transfiguration of Oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This wastes carbon dioxide and makes the CO2-fixing less efficient. Does not produce glucose.

                <h3> C4 Plants</h3>

Examples of C4 plants include:
Pineapples
Corn
Sugar Cane

C4 plants have a more efficient way to fix carbon dioxide.
Instead of rubisco they combine with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the mesophyll cells to form oxaloacetate, a four-carbon compound. 
This enzyme that fixes PEP is PEP carboxylase which has a high affinity for CO2 even under low concentrations.
Oxaloacetate is quickly formed into malate which enters the bundle sheath cells and is converted to pyruvate and carbon dioxide. 
	Carbon dioxide is then released into the regular Calvin Cycle to make glucose. This cycle is particularly useful for plants that grow in hot, dry climates enabling them to fix CO2 even in low supply.

<h3> CAM Plants</h3>
<pre>
<img src="http://www.aloesocietyzim.com/resources/Cacti.png"/>
CAM plants are known to close their Stomates in the day and open them at night.
This is so that they reduce water loss through transpiration. 
They developed their own method of photosynthesis called CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) photosynthesis.
CAM processes similar to C4 photosynthesis where PEP carboxylase is used to fix CO2 to oxaloacetate but instead it’s converted to malic acid instead of malate. 
Malic acid  (ionized malate) is sent to the cell's vacuole. During the day malic acid is converted to oxaloacetate and carbon dioxide is released for photosynthesis where the CO2 enters the Calvin Cycle.
